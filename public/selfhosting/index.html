    Self-hosting and perils beyond (part 1)</h1>

  <p>Last September, my colleague Kaustubh gave a wonderful talk about how he is self-hosting from an old laptop. He spoke very excitedly about his intentions with it, and how he achieved everything. Kaustabh technical know-how is exceptional, and his communicated the idea very simply.</p>
<p>It finally gave me a sense of what people say when they use the term “server”. I think it never struck me that it quite literally means “to serve”. So the server, <em>serves</em> websites or other computatational things!</p>
<p>After the talk, I was super excited and wondering what it might mean to host my own server, and if I could potentially do it with a rapsberry pi 4 that is lying around!</p>
<h2 id="solar-dreams">Solar dreams</h2>
<p>In Oct/Nov 2024, I sat in on a info session from Rhizome.org, where a speaker explained a long standing project called <strong>Solar Protocol</strong>. This also hosts simple websites on a raspberry pi - the amazing part is that they use Solar power to keep everything running!</p>
<p>My combined excitement of selfhosting, raspberry pis and solar power source has kicked in hard in 2025 and this post is just a long form of things I did.</p>
<h2 id="yunohost-and-isp-woes">Yunohost and ISP woes!</h2>
<p>After digging through basic resources like r/selfhosted and other lists. I found the documentation for Yunohost (pronounced Y-U-No-Host), very simple and easy to try. There was no code required for the setup. While I can code some and SSH into raspberry pis, I find that if the setup is easy, its a format/tool that I can share with others who aren’t technologists. To me arming with understanding technology makers is always as exhilirating learning something new myself.</p>
<p>Sure enough, this a simple image flash, YUNOHOST was installed and the admin panel was running as a browser interface!</p>
<p>The diagnostics tool told me that everything was looking fine aside from my port forwarding.</p>
<p>[what does this mean - need some explainer/drawing]</p>
<p>After some more youtube-ing, and weird bumps on the way, I was able to get all the port forwarding details in place. But nothing worked!</p>
<p>I called my ISP team, and they assured me it wasn’t on their end and all the ports were open! So I struggled a bit more, searching through the internet and youtube!</p>
<p>In the searches, two things kept coming back:</p>
<ol>
<li>A playlist by Pi-hosted which uses RaspiOS+portainer.io (a docker something) and,</li>
<li>“Tunneling” instead of port forwarding</li>
</ol>
<p>I kept resisting the solutions trying my best to get Yunohost up and running. Finally the ISP connected me to their senior networking engineer, and he explained that I have to buy the public static IP. This service is 2.5x the cost in Udaipur (perhaps as the ISP is local this request is not as common).</p>
<p>After a quick chat with Kaustubh about this, I decided to try a tunnel with Cloudflare, again I could’nt get this to work with Yunohost.</p>
<p>Apparently, Yunohost once installed and running with portforwarding will split the use of the localhost and the dedicated domain in two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>the localhost will serve only as admin interface
[add screenshot]</li>
<li>the domain will serve the frontend/dashboard for your services
[add screeshot]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="back-to-drawing-board">Back to drawing board</h2>
<p>After all the Yunohost tears were wiped off. The steps were pretty clear:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install raspiOS headless (this was easy as I have tried this several times)</li>
<li>Test the services I want to host like the LLM, Jellyfin etc.</li>
<li>Host via docker to things are running neatly in containers (I’m still a noob on this stuff - but had to figure it out as best I could)</li>
<li>Test the services on docker and decide what happens next</li>
<li>Take the plunge into solar powering this shindig!</li>
<li>See where this goes! :)</li>
</ol>
<p>For this post, I will focus on steps 2, 3 and 4 (Step 5 is still a dream)!</p>

<p>NOTE: All this was done entirely on SSH.</p>

<h2 id="bro-can-you-even-llm">Bro, can you even LLM?</h2>
<p>Hosting an LLM on the Raspberry Pi was my main goal. After building Mother Machines v2 last year, I’ve been thinking a lot of local computing. There is something very empowering to discover that your computer (‘daily driver’) can actually generate AI images. Imagine if a tiny computer like a raspberry pi can run a chatbot!</p>
<p>The steps for this were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run ollama with a simple and smolLM. I used Tinyllama! Choice of the model was PURELY based on the fact that it was called “Tiny”llama.</li>
<li>Connect to <a href="https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui">openwebUI’s chat interface</a></li>
<li>Test in local network</li>
<li>Tunnel via Cloudflare!</li>
</ol>
<p>All these steps worked quite well, but obviously they stop when close the terminal (I’m a forever noob with terminal things)</p>

<h3 id="trying-docker">Trying Docker</h3>
<p>I have never used docker but it seemed to be an easy and well documented format for servers and in particular for raspberry pi as a server. You can find out more about raspberry pi hosting here: <a href="https://pi-hosted.com/">https://pi-hosted.com/</a>, by the amazing youtuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrjKdwxaQMSV_NDywgKXVmw">Nova spirit tech</a>.</p>
<p>You can follow the instructions available on their website!</p>
<p>Once I tested simpler Docker containers like Jellyfin, etc. I</p>
