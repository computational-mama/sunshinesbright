The quest was on to check general speed and lightness of Small Language Models. At the moment I've tried [tinyllama](https://ollama.com/library/tinyllama) and [tinydolphin](https://ollama.com/library/tinydolphin). As test I ask these four questions, the first two are a bit more generic, and 3 and 4 are closer to my research and experiments: 

| S.No. | Question | Answer should have been | 
|--|--|---|
|1.| What is the capital of India?| New Delhi|
|2.| Who was the emperor before Julius Caesar? | Julius Caesar was not an emperor, he was a dictator. Before his reign, Rome was governed by a Senate. [Also, Caesar's heir Augustus was later the founder of the Rome, and it's first Emperor.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus)  |
|3.| Who is Gayatri Spivak? |[ Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak (born 24 February 1942)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayatri_Chakravorty_Spivak) is an Indian scholar, literary theorist, and feminist critic.[1] She is a University Professor at Columbia University and a founding member of the establishment's Institute for Comparative Literature and Society |
|4.| What is her most famous written piece | Spivak is best known for her essay "Can the Subaltern Speak?" and her translation of and introduction to Jacques Derrida's De la grammatologie. |
