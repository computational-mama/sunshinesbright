## Why Solar?
I've pondering about this idea to have some solar powered infrastructure. Primarily for my AI/LLM type work. It hit to me a lot more pursuasively when I found that Udaipur, where I live, has the most number of clear sky days (over 200!). So it seemed like an obvious move to try this.

## Why Now?
Mix of motivation, money, better knowledge and general inspiration.

## How can you help?
Aside from good vibes and good sunshine:
- Ping me to learn about setting it up
- Help me with setting up easier formats to help other's self host
- Solar serve your work with me!
