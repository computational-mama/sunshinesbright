## Why Solar?
I've pondering about this idea to have some solar powered infrastructure. Primarily for my AI/LLM type work. It hit to me a lot more pursuasively when I found that Udaipur, where I live, has the most number of clear sky days (over 200!). So it seemed like an obvious move to try this. 

## Why Now?
Mix of motivation, money, better knowledge and general inspiration.
