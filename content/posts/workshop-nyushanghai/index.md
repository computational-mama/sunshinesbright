In April 2025, I was able to share the idea of hosting your own language models at [Interactive Media Arts, NYU Shanghai](https://ima.shanghai.nyu.edu/) through a small workshop!

While on its own,[ setting up the solar server's software/server](https://solararchive.cmama.xyz/how/) system is quite simple! What was challenging was to figure it out at the University, where restricted internet access and proxy system's setup are part of state mandates. Anyway after a tough few hours, this was the simple system I figured out on the wireless network of the 3D Printer (which didn't have access to the internet!)

> learnt a lot of bash commands! :P

The workshop included:

1. Accessing Raspberry Pi via SSH
2. Installing Docker and Ollama
3. Test Ollama with Tinyllama
4. Use the API endpoint from the Rapsberry Pi to control a p5.js sketch! :)
